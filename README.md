# 📈 STMES-TimeSeries-Forecasting

**Statistical Time Series Modelling for Predictive Epidemic Surveillance (STMES)**  
This project explores statistical time series models for forecasting epidemic trends using real-world illness and outbreak data. Developed as part of a data science/statistics course, it integrates R and Python-based analysis.
